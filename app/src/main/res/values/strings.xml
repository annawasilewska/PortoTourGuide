        Before CAVE 45 there was not one bar in Porto solely dedicated to hard & pure ROCK - without any concession to electronic music, pop music or comercial music.
        As the monster created by Dr. Frankenstein, CAVE 45 is a monster composed by different parts, taken by this monster called ROCK, be it Garage, Hardcore, Metal, Punk, Rockabilly, Stoner …
        And what a better place for underground music than a basement?
        Besides the basement ("cave" in portuguese) itself CAVE 45 is composed by a ground floor.
        The ground floor is a bar with no dj\'s - the music is chosen by whoever is working at the bar.
        You can seat down, have a chat and a drink without being annoyed by extremely loud music, because a bar is not a disco.
        This space is open from wednesday till saturday.
        The basement ("the cave") is a bigger place, designed for concerts and parties, with walls painted by artists and tattooists chosen by us.
        This space is open only in weekend nights or when there are concerts being held.
